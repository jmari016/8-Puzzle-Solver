# 8-Puzzle-Solver
8-Puzzle solver using uniform cost search and two variant A* search's

This is Project #1 for Professor Niloofar Montazeri for CS 170 at University of California, Riverside. 
The program searches for the cheapest path to solve the puzzle using either a uniform cost search,
A* with misplaced tile heuristic, or an A* with euclidean distance heuristic. A more detailed write-up
as well as sample test cases can be found in the attached document.
